## Spam/Ham Classification using Natural Language Processing

# Description:
 Developed a machine learning model to classify SMS(s) as Spam or Ham using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Key Technologies:

-Python
-NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
-Pandas
-NumPy
-Scikit-learn
-Key Components:

## Data Preprocessing:
Utilized NLTK for text tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization. 
Employed CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer for feature extraction.
Model Development: Built classifiers using Random Forest.
Validation Techniques: Implemented K-Fold Cross-Validation and Train Test Split for model evaluation.
K-Fold Cross-Validation accuracy: 0.97486535, 0.97666068, 0.97755835, 0.96495957, 0.97394429
Train Test Split accuracy: 0.937

## Outcomes:

Demonstrated higher accuracy with K-Fold Cross-Validation compared to Train Test Split, highlighting the robustness and reliability of the model.
Successfully improved the classification accuracy and reliability through rigorous cross-validation techniques.
